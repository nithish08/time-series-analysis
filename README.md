# Time Series Analysis


1. Random Walk, Auto Correlation Factor, Time Series Decomposition
2. Stationarity, AR, MA processes.
3. PACF and indentifying AR, MA processes.
4. AR MA processes deep dive
5. Non Stationary models like ARIMA, SARIMA
6. Multivariate Time Series models SARIMAX, VAR


code -

1. ACF, PACF plots
2. Using ARIMA, ARMA, SARIMA, VAR
3. ADF Test (Stationarity Test)
4. Ljung-Box test of autocorrelation in residuals
